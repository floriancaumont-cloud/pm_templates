# Outcomes vs Output

Shipping features is output.  
Changing behavior is outcome.  
Creating value is impact.

## Definitions
- **Output:** What you build
- **Outcome:** What users do differently
- **Impact:** Business result

## Why Output Is a Trap
- Easy to measure
- Feels productive
- Rarely guarantees value

## Outcome-Driven Product Management
- Start with desired behavior change
- Experiment before committing
- Measure learning, not just delivery

## Example
**Output:** Release onboarding flow  
**Outcome:** Increase activation rate  
**Impact:** Higher retention and revenue

## Key Takeaways
- Outputs are means, not goals
- Outcomes align teams
- Impact is the ultimate measure
