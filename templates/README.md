# Product Management Templates

This folder contains practical, lightweight templates covering the full product lifecycle.

These templates are designed to:
- Encourage clear thinking
- Reduce unnecessary documentation
- Focus teams on outcomes, not outputs
- Be adaptable to different product contexts

They are intentionally simple.  
Use what helps, adapt what doesn’t, ignore the rest.
