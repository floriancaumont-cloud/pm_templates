# Product Case Studies

This section contains real or simulated product case studies.

The goal is not to showcase perfect outcomes, but to:
- Demonstrate product thinking
- Show decision-making under constraints
- Share trade-offs and learnings
- Make reasoning explicit

These case studies focus on *how decisions were made*, not just *what was built*.
