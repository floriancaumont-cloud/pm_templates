# Problem vs Solution Thinking

Strong Product Managers fall in love with problems, not solutions.

Jumping to solutions too early leads to:
- Feature bloat
- Misaligned outcomes
- Expensive rework

## What Is a Good Problem Statement?
A good problem statement:
- Is user-centered
- Is observable and measurable
- Avoids prescribing solutions
- Explains why it matters

**Bad:** “We need a dashboard”  
**Good:** “Users cannot understand their performance without manual work”

## Symptoms vs Root Causes
- Symptoms are visible
- Root causes create leverage

PMs must dig beneath what users say to understand what they need.

## User Problems vs Business Problems
- User problems drive adoption
- Business problems drive sustainability

Great products solve both simultaneously.

## Key Takeaways
- Solutions expire, problems persist
- Clarity of problem enables creativity in solutions
- Validation starts before building
