# Decision Making as a PM

PMs make decisions with incomplete information every day.

## Types of Decisions
- Reversible vs irreversible
- Strategic vs tactical
- Short-term vs long-term

## Data vs Judgment
- Data informs decisions
- Judgment fills the gaps
- Waiting for certainty is a decision itself

## Trade-Offs
Every decision says:
- Yes to something
- No to something else

PMs must own those trade-offs.

## Key Takeaways
- Perfect information doesn’t exist
- Speed matters, but clarity matters more
- Accountability builds trust
