# What Is Product Management?

Product Management is the practice of identifying valuable problems and guiding teams to deliver solutions that create measurable impact for users and the business.

A Product Manager operates at the intersection of:
- User needs
- Business goals
- Technical feasibility

The role exists to ensure teams are building the right things, not just building things right.

## What Product Management Is
- A discipline focused on outcomes and impact
- A continuous process of learning, deciding, and prioritizing
- A balance between discovery and delivery
- A role of clarity in environments full of uncertainty

## What Product Management Is Not
- Project management
- Writing tickets all day
- Acting as a proxy manager for engineers
- Being the sole idea generator
- Owning everything without accountability

## Product vs Project
| Product | Project |
|------|--------|
| Continuous | Time-bound |
| Outcome-focused | Output-focused |
| Evolves with learning | Fixed scope |
| Long-term value | Short-term delivery |

## Why Product Management Exists
Without Product Management:
- Teams optimize for speed, not value
- Features replace outcomes
- Decisions are driven by opinions, not evidence

Product Managers exist to reduce waste and increase impact.

## Key Takeaways
- PMs maximize value, not activity
- Product Management is a mindset before it’s a role
- Context always matters
